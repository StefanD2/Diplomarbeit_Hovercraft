The main aim of this diploma project is to convert a inflatable dinghy to an operative hovercraft, 
which is able to drive on land and water. The hovercraft has 2 motors and propellers, one for floating and the other 
one for the electric drive. \\
To control the motors we have two thumb throttles, which are attached to the handlebar. \\
The construction on the boat is made of wood. Electrical components, such as motors and propellers were 
purchased. \\
To charge the batteries a charger has to be plugged in, so that the accumulators are able to stay in the Hovercraft
during the whole charging process.
