The aim of our diploma thesis is to build a functional electrical hovercraft, which is able to move on land and on water.\\
A electrical motor attached to propeller facing downwards creates an airflow on which the boot hovers. The second propeller points to the back and therefore produces forward thrust. In order to steer the hovercraft there are three servo-controlled fins behind the propeller to redirect the airflow.\\
The driver is able to steer the vehicle with a handlebar and two thumb throttles.

% The main aim of this diploma project is to convert a inflatable dinghy to an operative hovercraft, 
% which is able to drive on land and water. The hovercraft has 2 motors and propellers, one for floating and the other 
% one for the electric drive. \\
% To control the motors we have two thumb throttles, which are attached to the handlebar. \\
% The construction on the boat is made of wood. Electrical components, such as motors and propellers were 
% purchased. \\
% To charge the batteries a charger has to be plugged in, so that the accumulators are able to stay in the Hovercr    aft
% during the whole charging process.
