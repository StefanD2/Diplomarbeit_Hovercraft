    The aim of our diploma thesis was to build a functional electrical hovercraft, which is able to move over land as well as water.
    An electrical motor attached to a propeller facing downwards creates an airflow on which the boot hovers. The second propeller points to the back and therefore produces forward thrust. In order to steer the hovercraft, there are three servo-controlled fins behind the propeller to redirect the airflow.
    The driver is able to steer the vehicle with a handlebar and two thumb throttles.
